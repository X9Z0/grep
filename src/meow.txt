**Meow, Meow**  
Soft paws on the floor,  
A flick of the tail, wanting more.  
Golden eyes in moonlight's glow,  
Silent whispers â€” soft meows low.  

Purring close, a playful bite,  
Chasing shadows through the night.  
Curled up tight as dreams take flight,  
Meow, meow â€” sleep feels right. ðŸ˜¸
